# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, this is Md Emon Hossen

I am a passionate web developer. My journey as a web developer began with a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, which allowed me to build solid websites. Over time, I expanded my knowledge and dived into frameworks like **Laravel**, enabling me to develop dynamic and interactive web applications.

My attention to detail and dedication to crafting clean, well-structured code are central to my development process.  
I also have experience in **manual testing, API testing, database testing, SQL queries**, and possess a strong understanding of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Bug Life Cycle, and Test Reports**.
